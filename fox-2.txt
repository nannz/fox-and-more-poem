I think I know.
Its owner is quite happy though.
Full of joy 
like a vivid rainbow.

red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple, pink

She gives her fox a shake
and laughs until her belly aches
the only other sound's the break
of ditant waves and rabbits awake

The fox is curious, oragne, and deep,
But she has promises to keep, 
After cake and lots of sleep,
Sweet dreams come to her.
